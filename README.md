# Week One Homework - Website Alt Text and Code Fixes

## Getting Started

This project involves refactoring an existing website by adding appropriate alt text to images and fixing broken code in the `index.html` file. Alt text helps improve accessibility for users with visual impairments, and fixing broken code ensures a smoother user experience.

## User Story

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Issues Created / Solutions

  1. Added Alt language to all 7 image/icons
  2. Commented out all font families within each element, and created one common class.
  3. Adjusted an id link on the index file, to link correctly.
